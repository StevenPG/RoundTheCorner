Round The Corner is a simple android application that served the purpose of lea\
rning how to use standard Android library functions like Views, Notifications, \
Location Services, Background Services, and multiple others.

The application takes inputs from the user and checks the distance between the \
device and the location found through geo-caching.

The user enters a location and a distance. When the device is within the input \
distance to the input location, a text message is automatically send to the inp\
